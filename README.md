- Compiling and Running the C++ Program:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the C++ file (prime_finder_multithreaded.cpp).
3. Compile the program:

Compiling and Running the C++ Program:

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the C++ file (prime.cpp).
3. Compile the program (using MinGW as an example):

- For Command Prompt (CMD):

```cmd
